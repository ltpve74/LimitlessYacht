# Limitless Yacht — Agent Guidelines

Read this before editing the site. The repo uses a **three-tier workflow**: feature branches for individual work, `develop` as the integration branch (readable source, always matches what's live), and `main` for minified production.

---

## Quick start (agents)

```sh
git checkout develop                         # integration branch — always start here
git config core.hooksPath .githooks          # one-time per clone
```

| Question | Answer |
|----------|--------|
| Local preview without GitHub Pages? | `python3 scripts/dev-server.py` → http://127.0.0.1:8765/ (analytics off on localhost) |
| Which branch is the source of truth? | **`develop`** — always reflects what's on the live site |
| Feature work? | Branch from `develop`, work there, merge back into `develop` when done |
| Which files are source of truth? | `index.html`, `legal.html`, `css/main.css`, `data/reviews.json`, `i18n/locales/*.py` |
| Which files are generated? | `de/`, `es/`, `fr/` HTML and `data/reviews-{de,es,fr}.json` — never hand-edit |
| When do locales rebuild? | On commit to `develop` (if EN source changed) |
| When does minification happen? | On commit to **`main`** only (publish step) |
| Publish QA gate? | Pre-commit on **`main`**: minify → `scripts/publish-gate.py` (site tests + UX smoke + Lighthouse). CI: `.github/workflows/publish.yml` |
| What goes live? | Push to **`main`** → Netlify deploys `limitlessyachtcharter.com` |
| Preview branch? | **`develop` only** → GitHub Pages preview. Feature branches must be merged into `develop` first. |
| Analytics on preview? | **Off** — `js/analytics-env.js` sets `LY_OWNER_MODE` on `*.github.io`, localhost, Netlify branch deploys |
| Analytics on production? | **On** — `limitlessyachtcharter.com` only (verified in publish gate) |

## Visual feedback: the `screenshots/` folder

The repo owner uses a **local, untracked `screenshots/` folder** (repo root) to give visual
feedback to whoever is working on the site — Claude Code or another agent.

| Fact | Detail |
|------|--------|
| Location | `screenshots/` at the repo root |
| In git? | **No** — it is deliberately *not* committed (local-only scratch). It may be absent in a fresh clone or remote/CI checkout. |
| Purpose | The owner drops in screenshots showing a bug, a current state, and/or the desired state |
| How to read | **Check it at the start of a visual/UX task.** If present and non-empty, open the images before changing layout/CSS/scroll behaviour |

**Reading conventions**

- When two images are provided for one issue, the owner's message says which is which.
  The common pattern is: **first = current/buggy behaviour, second = desired behaviour.**
- Images often include the browser/device chrome (e.g. iPhone SE 375×667, DPR/Save-Data
  toggles) — use that to reproduce at the same viewport.
- The folder may not exist or may be empty in a remote/cloud session (it is not pushed).
  If you cannot find it, say so and ask the owner to paste the images into the chat instead.

**For agents:** treat `screenshots/` as read-only feedback input. Do **not** commit it, add it
to git, or delete its contents. Reproduce the reported state with Playwright at the matching
viewport before and after your fix to confirm you've addressed what the screenshot shows.

---

## Analytics & preview (do not pollute GA / Clarity)

**Single source of truth:** `js/analytics-env.js` (load first in `<head>` on `index.html` and `legal.html`).

| Host | `LY_IS_PREVIEW` | Analytics |
|------|-----------------|-------------|
| `*.github.io` (GitHub Pages preview) | yes | Suppressed |
| `localhost` / `127.0.0.1` | yes | Suppressed |
| `*.netlify.app` (not production domain) | yes | Suppressed |
| `limitlessyachtcharter.com` | no | **Live** (GA4/Ads, Clarity, behavior-analytics) |

When suppressed (`LY_OWNER_MODE`), the site skips: Google tag, Microsoft Clarity, `behavior-analytics.js`, cookie banner, and conversion `dataLayer` events.

**Owner override (any host):** visit `?ly_owner=set` once to suppress on that browser; `?ly_owner=unset` to re-enable.

### Daily dev / preview workflow

1. Work on `develop`, push → GitHub Pages preview deploys.
2. Preview automatically suppresses analytics — safe for UX iteration and agent testing.
3. Do **not** remove analytics snippets from HTML; suppression is host-based.

### Go-live workflow (re-enable analytics on production)

Analytics turn back on automatically when Netlify serves `limitlessyachtcharter.com` — no manual toggle.

Before pushing `main`:

```sh
python3 scripts/verify-analytics.py   # preview guard + production IDs present
python3 scripts/publish-gate.py       # includes verify-analytics + site tests + UX + Lighthouse
```

After deploy (~60s), spot-check production:

```sh
curl -sL https://limitlessyachtcharter.com/ | grep -o 'AW-18209943491'
curl -sL https://limitlessyachtcharter.com/ | grep -o 'analytics-env.js'
```

Expect: both match. On preview (`ltpve74.github.io/LimitlessYacht/`), `analytics-env.js` is present but Clarity/gtag must not load (check DevTools Network tab).

**Publish gate** (`scripts/publish-gate.py` on `main` commit): runs `verify-analytics.py` after `test-site.py`.

## Branch strategy

| Branch | Purpose | HTML/CSS format | Pre-commit on commit |
|--------|---------|-----------------|----------------------|
| `develop` | Integration — always matches what's live | Readable (multi-line) | Rebuild locales when EN source changes. **No minify.** |
| feature branches | Individual work (lead-gen, 3g-opt, etc.) | Readable | Same as develop. Merge into `develop` when ready. |
| `main` | Production (Netlify) | Minified (single-line) | **Minify → publish gate** (site tests, UX smoke, Lighthouse). Locales already built on dev. |

**Rules**
- `develop` is the single source of truth — it always reflects what's on the live site.
- Feature branches fork from `develop`, get merged back into `develop` when complete.
- Never minify on `develop` or feature branches.
- Never edit English source directly on `main` — always merge from `develop`.
- Never hand-edit `de/`, `es/`, `fr/` HTML — use `i18n/build-locales.py`.
- Locales are built **once** on dev; publish only minifies (no double locale rebuild).

---

## Development workflow

### 1. Make changes (on `develop`)

Edit source files:

- **Pages:** `index.html`, `legal.html`
- **Styles:** `css/main.css`
- **Translations:** `i18n/locales/de.py`, `es.py`, `fr.py`
- **JS:** `js/` (shared; not locale-generated)
- **Images:** `images/`, `images/mobile/`

### 2. Translations (when English copy changes)

For every new or changed visible English string:

1. Add matching tuples to **all three** locale files (`PAIRS` or `LEGAL_PAIRS`).
2. English side of each tuple must match the HTML **exactly** (whitespace, tags, classes).
3. Order in the lists does not matter (build sorts longest-first).

Calendar month/day labels live in locale modules (`MONTHS`, `DOW`).

**Guest reviews:** English copy lives in `data/reviews.json`. Translations live in each locale module as `REVIEWS` (plus `REVIEWS_UI` for JS labels). `build-locales.py` writes `data/reviews-de.json`, `data/reviews-es.json`, `data/reviews-fr.json` and patches each locale page to fetch the matching file. When adding or editing a review, update **English JSON and all three `REVIEWS` lists** (same count, same `author`/`rating`).

### 3. Add tests for new behaviour

Any new or changed functionality must include checks in `scripts/test-site.py` (HTML structure, JS patterns, CSS rules, or asset paths as appropriate). The pre-commit hook on `main` runs the full suite — missing tests means regressions can ship unnoticed.

### 4. Stage and commit

```sh
git add index.html legal.html css/main.css i18n/locales/ scripts/test-site.py   # as needed
git commit -m "Describe the change"
```

**Pre-commit on `develop`** (if staged files include `index.html`, `legal.html`, or `i18n/locales/*.py`):

1. Runs `python3 i18n/build-locales.py`
2. Stages regenerated `de/`, `es/`, `fr/` pages
3. Does **not** minify

You can run the build manually first:

```sh
python3 i18n/build-locales.py
```

**Tip:** Stage English edits before committing so the hook sees final source.

### 5. Push dev branch (optional preview)

```sh
git push origin develop
```

---

## Publishing workflow (dev → production)

Use this when the user asks to **go live** or **publish**.

```sh
# 1. Ensure dev branch is committed and pushed
git checkout develop
git status   # clean working tree

# 2. Merge into main (prefer dev version on conflicts)
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git merge develop
# If conflicts: git checkout --theirs <file>   # dev wins
git add -A

# 3. Commit on main — hook minifies + publish gate (no locale rebuild)
#    One-time QA setup: scripts/setup-qa.sh
git commit -m "Publish: <summary of changes>"

# 4. Deploy
git push origin main
```

**Pre-commit on `main`** (every commit):

1. Runs `python3 scripts/minify_html.py` (HTML + `css/main.css`)
2. Runs `python3 scripts/publish-gate.py` (site tests, UX smoke, Lighthouse budgets)
3. Re-stages minified files

**Netlify** (`netlify.toml`): `publish = "."` — no build step. Serves committed files as-is.

**Verify live** (after ~30–60s):

```sh
curl -sL https://limitlessyachtcharter.com/ | head -c 500
```

## Common mistakes (avoid)

| Mistake | Why it's wrong |
|---------|----------------|
| Editing `main` HTML directly | Files are minified; changes are unreadable and bypass locale build |
| Hand-editing `de/es/fr/` HTML or `data/reviews-*.json` | Overwritten on next locale build |
| Adding a review only to `data/reviews.json` | Locale `REVIEWS` lists must stay in sync — build will fail |
| Running `minify_html.py` on dev branch | Destroys readable source |
| Committing on `main` without merging dev | Skips readable source of truth |
| Forgetting locale `.py` tuples | Non-English pages keep old or English text |
| Expecting Netlify to minify | It does not — minify happens in pre-commit on `main` |
| Testing UX on preview with Clarity/GA open | Preview suppresses automatically; use production URL to validate tags |
| Removing analytics snippets before preview | Wrong — use `analytics-env.js` host detection instead |

## Navigation / scrolling

**Always use native browser anchor navigation.** CSS handles positioning:

- `html { scroll-padding-top }` — keeps anchors below the fixed nav
- `#target { scroll-margin-top }` — per-element viewport-specific offsets
- `html { scroll-behavior: smooth }` under `@media (prefers-reduced-motion: no-preference)`

Only reach for JS when doing something genuinely beyond native capability:

- Scrolling to a *different* element than the href target (e.g. skipping a hidden section header)
- Activating a tab or triggering a side effect alongside navigation
- In those cases: fire the JS, then let the native action complete — do not replicate scrolling in JS

Never intercept anchor clicks just to recompute a scroll offset that CSS already handles.

---

## CSS architecture

- Mobile breakpoint: `max-width: 640px`
- Tablet breakpoint: `max-width: 768px` / `min-width: 769px`
- `scroll-padding-top`: 5rem default, 4.9rem at ≤640px, 6.25rem at 769–1100px
- Viewport-conditional landing (e.g. `#enquire`): use `scroll-margin-top` inside `@media (min-height: …)` queries — no JS

---

## Anchor position pattern

Zero-height span marks the exact landing point inside a section:

```html
<span id="target" style="display:block;height:0;overflow:hidden" aria-hidden="true"></span>
```

Place the span where content should appear on landing; use `scroll-margin-top` in CSS to reveal content above it on tall viewports.
